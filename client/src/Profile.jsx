The event featured industry experts who shared their insights on cutting-edge technologies and real-world applications. \n\nThe event kicked off with an enlightening session on \"Monitoring Infrastructure and Microservices with Elastic Observability\" by the esteemed\nAshish Tiwari  from Elastic. Ashish sir delved into the importance of observability in a distributed environment and how Elastic's tools can help monitor and troubleshoot complex microservices architectures effectively. \n\nNext up, we had the pleasure of hearing from Manan Bhatt, shared his expertise on \"Building Event Driven Distributed Applications with Conductor.\" He explored the power of event-driven architectures and how Conductor, a powerful orchestration engine, can simplify the development and management of such applications. .\n\nI would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Zone Startup for organizing such an enlightening event. \n\n#ZoneStartup #Microservices #DistributedApplications #EventRecap #ElasticObservability #Conductor #NetflixConductor #TechnologyAdvancements",
