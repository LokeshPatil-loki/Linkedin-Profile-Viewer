**Node.js installation**


**1. Download Node.js:**

Visit the Node.js official website (https://nodejs.org/), and download the LTS (Long Term Support) version, which is recommended for most use cases. There's also a Current version, but it may not be as stable as the LTS version.

**2. Install Node.js on Windows:**

- Run the installer you downloaded in step 1.
- Follow the installation wizard instructions.
- By default, Node.js will also install npm (Node Package Manager).


**3. Verify Installation:**

To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

These commands should display the installed Node.js and npm versions, respectively.

**4. Create a Simple JavaScript File:**

You can create a simple JavaScript file to test Node.js. For example, create a file named `hello.js` with the following content:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
```

**5. Run the JavaScript File:**

In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `hello.js` is located, and run the file using the `node` command:

```bash
node hello.js
```

You should see the output: "Hello, Node.js!"

**MongoDB installation**


**1. Download MongoDB:**

Visit the MongoDB official website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and download the Community Server version, which is free to use for most purposes.

**2. Install MongoDB:**

The installation steps may differ depending on your operating system:

**For Windows:**

- Run the installer you downloaded in step 1.
- Follow the installation wizard instructions.
- By default, MongoDB will be installed as a service that starts automatically with Windows. You can also choose to run it as a service or use manual startup.

**3. Start the MongoDB Server:**

MongoDB server must be running to use the database. The steps to start the server depend on your OS:

**For Windows:**

If you installed MongoDB as a service, it should start automatically. You can also manually start, stop, or restart the service using the "Services" application.


The MongoDB server should be running on the default port 27017.

**4. Verify Installation:**

You can check the MongoDB version and connect to it using the MongoDB shell. Open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
mongo --version
```

This command will display the installed MongoDB version.

**5. Connect to MongoDB:**

To connect to the MongoDB server, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
mongo
```

This will launch the MongoDB shell, where you can interact with the database.


**Clone the repository**


**1. Install Git:**
   If you haven't already, you need to install Git on your local machine. You can download it from the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/).

**2. Configure Git:**
   Before cloning, it's a good practice to configure Git with your name and email address. Open a terminal/command prompt and run these commands, replacing "Your Name" and "youremail@example.com" with your actual information:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
   ```

**3. Navigate to GitHub:**
   Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com/) and log in to your GitHub account.

**4. Find the Repository:**
   Locate the GitHub repository you want to clone. You can use the GitHub search bar or navigate through your repositories, organizations, or other users' repositories.

**5. Clone the Repository:**
   Once you've found the repository, follow these steps:

   - Click the "Code" button on the repository's main page. It looks like a green button with the word "Code" on it.
   - You'll see a URL in a dropdown. Click the clipboard icon next to it to copy the repository's URL to your clipboard.

**6. Open a Terminal/Command Prompt:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

**7. Navigate to the Directory Where You Want to Clone the Repository:**
   Use the `cd` command to move to the directory where you want to place the cloned repository. For example, if you want to clone the repository into your "Documents" folder, you can navigate there with:

   ```bash
   cd Documents
   ```

**8. Clone the Repository:**
   To clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine, use the `git clone` command and paste the URL you copied earlier. The command looks like this:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   For example, if your repository URL is `https://github.com/username/my-repo.git`, you would run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/my-repo.git
   ```

**9. Enter Your GitHub Credentials:**
   When you run the `git clone` command, Git may prompt you to enter your GitHub username and password or access token, depending on your repository's settings. Enter your credentials to proceed.

**10. Clone Completed:**
   After successfully cloning the repository, you will see a message indicating that the repository has been cloned. You can now navigate to the cloned directory using the `cd` command and start working with the code.

That's it! You've successfully cloned a GitHub repository to your local machine, and you can now make changes, create branches, and work with the code locally.
